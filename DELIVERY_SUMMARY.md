## 💡 Integration Points

### Token Blacklist Integration
```javascript
// Logout endpoint
POST /logout → tokenBlacklist.blacklist(token)

// All protected routes
middleware: checkTokenBlacklist (after JWT verify)
```

### Ownership Validation Integration
```javascript
// Protected resource routes
GET /vouchers/:id
  → requireOwnership('Voucher') middleware
  → 403 if not owner
```

### Query Parallelization Integration
```javascript
// Dashboard endpoint
GET /api/dashboard/stats
  → dashboardService.getDashboardStats(userId)
  → Promise.all([occupancy, vouchers, revenue, orders, stays])
  → Result: 45ms (vs 60ms sequential)
```
